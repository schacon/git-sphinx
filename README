Git-Sphinx Script
=========================

Git-Sphinx is my attempt to write a script that will create proper sphinx indexes
directly from Git repositories, so you can search through ALL of your source code
near-instantly.

I've included a sample sphinx config file that uses the script to generate data
that is fed to it via the xmlpipe2 type.  You will have to modify index.rb
to return an array of repositories and paths that is appropriate for you.

TODO
=========================

* fix bugs with invalid characters in the content feed
* develop simple frontend (sinatra app) for searching that index usefully

LICENSE
=========================

MIT.  Do whatever you want with it.
